\title{Deliverables Summary}
\author{Michael McDonnell}

\maketitle
\section*{Introduction}

The thesis focus for the year was attempting to develop a system to allow a self driving vehicle to identify road features to set the conditions for navigation through features such as intersections.

The development attempted to follow an AGILE approach with iterative increases in functionality. A simulation system was developed to provide camera feed inputs to a Python process. The core deliverables discussed were:
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
	& \textbf{Journal or Conference paper.}
	& \textbf{Lightweight simulation.}
	& \textbf{Developed system.}
\end{easylist}

During the course of development familiarity was gained in a range of additional areas. Edge detection was investigated as an initial road detection attempt and the use of convolutional neural networks was investigated as an alternate option. As a result of this work outside the core system, the following additional deliverables have been developed:
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
	& \textbf{MATLAB assignment detail for Computational Problem Solving.} 
	& \textbf{Sprint review example.} 
	& Additional study \textbf{TODO: material? Disucssion?}
\end{easylist}



\section{Journal or Conference Paper}

It was identified that \textit{Robotics and Autonomous Systems} is a suitable journal to submit a paper to. This journal deals with the core subject material, has an impact factor of 2.928 and has a clearly detailed submission process. If the paper is not accepted into this journal alternative options will be considered including conferences including optimistically, the 17th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots (UR 2020) - Kyoto with a submission date of early 2020. A more flexible option is one of the various International Conferences on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision Engineering throughout 2020.

The initial draft is aligned to the Robotics and Autonomous systems general format however content, style and length can be massaged based on submission target.


\section*{Final words}
The project this year was ambitious, challenging and allowed development of conceptual understanding over a range of topics. In addition to the core academic deliverable requirements it is hoped that some of the additional delivered elements may assist others in delving deeper into some of these topics.
